Each plugin contains one or more elements that perform a particular task, such as reading from a file, decoding video, applying effects, or streaming media over a network. Plugins are categorized into groups like base, good, bad, and ugly based on their quality, licensing, and stability. They allow developers to create complex media pipelines by combining elements dynamically, making GStreamer highly flexible and extensible for diverse multimedia applications.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"my-tutorials/week-3/3-4":{"id":"my-tutorials/week-3/3-4","title":"3-4 Preparing GStreamer Plugins for Yocto Compilation","description":"This tutorial will guide you through cloning and modifying the gst-plugins-bad repository for a custom project.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"my-tutorials/week-3/3-5":{"id":"my-tutorials/week-3/3-5","title":"3-5 Editing Recipes and Recompiling Yocto Project","description":"This tutorial guides you on configuring and compiling the Yocto project to include a custom equirectangular GStreamer plugin.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"my-tutorials/week-3/3-6":{"id":"my-tutorials/week-3/3-6","title":"3-6 Perform Streaming Tests on RZ/G2L","description":"In this tutorial, we will perform streaming tests on RZ/G2L with hardware-specific encoder/decoder adjustments.
