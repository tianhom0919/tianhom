# 3-6 Perform Streaming Tests on RZ/G2L

In this tutorial, we will perform streaming tests on RZ/G2L with hardware-specific encoder/decoder adjustments. Then we will try to stream videos from RZ/G2L to PC using GStreamer commands.

## Basic Test

First, we can perform a basic test using a video test source. On the terminal of RZ/G2L (or serial monitor), run the following command:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink
```

Then, ensure the equirectangular filter is working properly by running:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,width=1920,height=1080 ! videoconvert ! equirectangular ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

The output should look like below:

![equirect](./img/3-6-0.png)

## Streaming Test

Now, we will stream from RZ/G2L to mini PC. On the terminal of Ubuntu 22.04, run the following command to wait for h.264 stream from RZ/G2L:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5000 ! application/x-rtp,media=video,clock-rate=90000,encoding-name=H264,payload=96 ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! autovideosink
```
