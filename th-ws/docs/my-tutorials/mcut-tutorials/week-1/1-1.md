# 1-1 Introduction and Basics of Linux

Linux is a powerful, open-source operating system (OS) that powers everything from servers and smartphones to embedded systems and personal computers. It is based on the UNIX operating system and is known for its stability, security, and versatility. Linux is widely used in software development, IT infrastructure, and various other industries.

Linux comes in various distributions (distros), such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS, each tailored for different use cases and user preferences. Linux's core strength lies in its terminal (command line interface), where users can execute commands to interact with the system directly.

## Basic Linux Commands

Here are some fundamental Linux commands every beginner should know:

### 1. File and Directory Management

- **`ls`**  
    Lists files and directories in the current working directory.

    ```bash
    ls
    ls -l   # Detailed list with permissions, size, etc.
    ls -a   # Includes hidden files
    ```

- **`cd`**  
    Changes the current directory.

    ```bash
    cd /home/user/Documents
    cd ..    # Moves up one directory
    cd ~     # Moves to the home directory
    ```

- **`pwd`**  
    Prints the current working directory.

    ```bash
    pwd
    ```

- **`mkdir`**  
    Creates a new directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir new_folder
    ```

- **`rm`**  
    Deletes files or directories.

    ```bash
    rm file.txt        # Deletes a file
    rm -r folder_name  # Deletes a directory and its contents
    ```

### 2. File Viewing and Editing

- **`cat`**  
    Displays the content of a file.

    ```bash
    cat file.txt
    ```

- **`nano`**  
    Opens a file in the Nano text editor for editing.

    ```bash
    nano file.txt
    ```

- **`head` and `tail`**  
    Displays the first or last few lines of a file.

    ```bash
    head file.txt      # First 10 lines
    tail file.txt      # Last 10 lines
    tail -n 20 file.txt # Last 20 lines
    ```

## 3. System Information

- **`whoami`**  
    Shows the current logged-in user.

    ```bash
    whoami
    ```

- **`uname`**  
    Displays system information.

    ```bash
    uname -a   # Detailed system info
    ```

- **`df`**  
    Displays disk space usage.

    ```bash
    df -h   # Human-readable format
    ```

## 4. Process Management

- **`ps`**  
    Displays currently running processes.

    ```bash
    ps
    ps aux   # Detailed view of all processes
    ```

- **`top`**  
    Shows real-time information about system processes and resource usage.

    ```bash
    top
    ```

- **`kill`**  
    Terminates a process using its Process ID (PID).

    ```bash
    kill 1234  # Kills the process with PID #1234
    ```

## 5. Permissions and Ownership

- **`chmod`**  
    Changes file permissions.

    ```bash
    chmod 755 script.sh  # Gives read, write, execute to the owner, and read/execute to others
    ```

- **`chown`**  
    Changes the ownership of a file or directory.

    ```bash
    chown user:group file.txt
    ```

## 6. Network Commands

- **`ping`**  
    Tests connectivity to a network address.

    ```bash
    ping google.com
    ```

- **`ifconfig` / `ip`**  
    Displays or configures network interfaces.

    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ip addr show
    ```

These commands provide a starting point for exploring Linux. Practice them to build confidence and efficiency in navigating and managing Linux systems.
