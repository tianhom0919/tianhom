# 4-1 Qt Cross-Platform Development

This chapter covers Qt development for building Aarch64 applications on PC platforms (Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows 11) and transferring them to the Renesas RZ/G2L target board for execution. Qt Creator is used as the primary development tool.

To optimize development efficiency, applications are built on PCs rather than directly on the target platform, as frequent program modifications and rebuilds are expected. The development architecture is outlined as follows:

**Windows 11:**
- Simplified setup for UI development.
- Download and install Qt 5.6.3, which suffices for this purpose.

**Ubuntu 22.04:**
- Additional toolkits are installed to enable builds for the Renesas RZ/G2L target board.
- This environment is used to produce the final software for deployment.

This chapter will guide you through setting up the Qt development environment on Ubuntu 22.04.
