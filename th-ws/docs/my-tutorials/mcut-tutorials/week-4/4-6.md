# 4-6 Introduction to RZ/G2L GPIOs

This chapter demonstrates how to test and develop programs to control the GPIO hardware pins on the Renesas RZ/G2L platform within a Linux environment. It covers using Linux Sysfs to manage GPIOs via file-based read/write commands.

---

## Linux Sysfs

Sysfs is a pseudo-filesystem in Linux that provides a way to interact with kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and drivers via virtual files.

To read a file, use the following command:

```bash
cat filename
```

To write to a file, use:

```bash
echo xxx > filename
```

## Accessing GPIO Pins

To access GPIO privileges on the RZ/G2L broad, navigate to `/sys/class/gpio/` and export the desired GPIO pin ID:

```bash
echo gpio-pin-id > export
```

:::tip[Renesas GPIO Pin IDs]

GPIO Pin IDs are calculated based on the port and pin as outlined in page 8 of [Renesas GPIO documentation](./docs/R01US0405EJ0111_GPIO_UME_v1.11.pdf). For RZ/G2L, the formula is shown below:

```
GPIO ID = (Port Number * 8) + Pin Number + 120
```

For **P42_4 (*Port 42, Pin 4*)**:

```
GPIO ID = (42 * 8) + 4 + 120 = 460
```

:::

After exporting the pins, a directory named after your pin (e.g. P42_4) will be created under the `/sys/class/gpio/` directory. Enter into the directory and use the command `ls` to list all the files.

The output will be:

```
active_low  device  direction  edge  power  subsystem  uevent  value
```

## Controlling GPIO Pins

To control GPIO pins, please ensure that you are in the `sys/class/gpio` directory.

**Setting Pin Direction**

```bash
echo "out" > direction
echo "in" > direction
```

**Writing Values To Pin**

```bash
echo 1 > value
echo 0 > value
```

**Reading The Pin State**

```bash
cat value
```

## Hardware Testing Through PMOD Interface

The **PMOD (Peripheral Module)** interface is a standardized connector used to interface peripheral modules with a host device, such as development boards, microcontrollers, or FPGAs. Developed by Digilent, PMOD connectors typically use a 6-pin or 12-pin header configuration, carrying signals such as power, ground, and data lines for SPI, I2C, UART, or GPIO communication. Designed for simplicity and flexibility, PMOD modules offer plug-and-play compatibility, enabling developers to easily add functionality like sensors, displays, and communication modules to projects without the need for complex wiring or additional circuitry.

Clone the GitHub repository below and build it in Qt Creator using the RZ/G2L kit.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourskc/q563_rzgpio.git
```

To match the configuration of the software program, please plug in the PMOD switch and LED according to the picture shown below. The PMOD switch should be connected to the 6 lower pins of `PMOD1`, and the PMOD LED should be connected to the 6 lower pins of `PMOD`.

Transfer the executable to RZ/G2L and run it. Try out the program and observe the output.
