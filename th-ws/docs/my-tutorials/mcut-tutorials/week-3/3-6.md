# 3-6 Perform Streaming Tests on RZ/G2L

In this tutorial, we will perform streaming tests on RZ/G2L with hardware-specific encoder/decoder adjustments. Then we will try to stream videos from RZ/G2L to PC using GStreamer commands.

---

## Basic Test

First, we can perform a basic test using a video test source. On the terminal of RZ/G2L (or serial monitor), run the following command:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! autovideosink
```

Then, ensure the equirectangular filter is working properly by running:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,width=1920,height=1080 ! videoconvert ! equirectangular ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

The output should look like below:

## Streaming Test

Now, we will stream from RZ/G2L to mini PC. On the terminal of Ubuntu 22.04, run the following command to wait for h.264 stream from RZ/G2L:

```bash
gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5000 ! application/x-rtp,media=video,clock-rate=90000,encoding-name=H264,payload=96 ! rtph264depay ! avdec_h264 ! autovideosink
```

Run the 3 scripts below, each with different sets of plugins:

```bash title="run1.sh"
gst-launch-1.0 -e filesrc location=./endo01.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! h264parse ! video/x-h264, stream-format=avc,alignment=au ! rtph264pay pt=96 name=pay0 config-interval=3 mtu=6000 ! udpsink host=your-ip-address port=5000
```

```bash title="run2.sh"
gst-launch-1.0 -e filesrc location=./endo01.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! h264parse ! omxh264dec ! omxh264enc ! rtph264pay config-interval=10 ! udpsink host=your-ip-address port=5000
```

```bash title="run3.sh"
h264parse ! omxh264dec ! videoconvert ! equirectangular ! videoconvert ! omxh264enc ! rtph264pay config-interval=10 ! udpsink host=your-ip-address port=5000
```

Note how different plugins may have an impact to the performance of the video streaming(eg. latency, frame rates, resolution).

:::warning

Remember to change the IP address to the assigned IP on your RZ/G2L board!

:::

### Local Streaming Test

```bash title="run4.sh"
gst-launch-1.0 -e filesrc location=./endo01.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! h264parse ! omxh264dec ! videoconvert ! equirectangular ! videoconvert ! autovideosink
```

:::tip

Since the execution speed is slow, some frames could be dropped during the playback. A longer mp4 test file is recommended as it would be better for demonstration purposes.
