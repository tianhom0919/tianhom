# 2-2 Setting Up Docker Container to Build Linux BSP for RZ/G2L

In this tutorial, we will learn how to setup a Docker container to build a Linux BSP for RZ/G2L. Then, we will write the image into an SD card and boot up RZ/G2L from it.

---

## Step 1: Create an Image Using a Dockerfile

To create an image, we will use a Dockerfile, which is a set of commands that will set up the container for us.

There are a few Ubuntu versions you may install:

- **Dockerfile.rzg_ubuntu-20.04**
- **Dockerfile.rzg_ubuntu-18.04**
- **Dockerfile.rzg_ubuntu-16.04**

In this tutorial, we will use **Dockerfile.rzg_ubuntu-20.04**.

Please click [here](./downloads/Dockerfile.rzg_ubuntu-20.04) to download it.

## Step 2: Building from Dockerfile

To build a Docker image, use the command below:

```bash
docker build --no-cache \
  --build-arg "host_uid=$(id -u)" \
  --build-arg "host_gid=$(id -g)" \
  --build-arg "USERNAME=$USER" \
  --build-arg "TZ_VALUE=$(cat /etc/timezone)" \
  --tag rz_ubuntu-20.04 \
  --file Dockerfile.rzg_ubuntu-20.04  .
```

You may change the `--tag` name according to your preferences. Then, confirm your images are created by using this command:

```bash
docker images
```

The output should look something like this:

```
REPOSITORY           TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
rz_ubuntu-20.04      latest    960cf1be32b0   57 seconds ago   1.25GB
```

## Step 3: Start and Run Your Container

Now that we have created the image, we can start a container using that image.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/$USER/yocto

docker run -it \
  --name=my_container_for_20.04 \
  --volume="/home/$USER/yocto:/home/$USER/yocto" \
  --workdir="/home/$USER" \
  rz_ubuntu-20.04
```

:::note[Parameters]
- `docker run`: Run a processes in isolated container
- `-it`: Starts a command shell inside your container that you can interact with
- `--name`: Chooses a name for your container
- `--volume`: Choose a directory on your host machine that you want to map inside your container to use as your shared directory
- `--workdir`: Choose a default directory where you want to start inside your container, for example your shared directory
:::

You will now be running in a command line shell inside your container. Now exit your container by typing `exit`.

```bash
your_username@(docker)$ exit
```

:::tip[Common Docker Commands]
```bash
$ docker images         # shows you your availible images
$ docker ps             # shows running containers
$ docker ps -a          # shows all containers (running and not running)
$ docker start -i <container>
$ docker rm <container> # remove a container
$ docker rmi <image>    # remove a image
```
:::

## Step 4: Download Renesas VLP Packages

Download the packages here: [RZ/G Verified Linux Package [5.10-CIP]](https://www.renesas.com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rz-mpus/rzg-linux-platform/rzg-marketplace/verified-linux-package/rzg-verified-linux-package)

These are the packages and patch files that you need to install:

**Packages:**
- **[RTK0EF0045Z0021AZJ-v3.0.6-update3.zip](./downloads/RTK0EF0045Z0021AZJ-v3.0.6-update3.zip)**
- **[RTK0EF0045Z13001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN.zip](./downloads/RTK0EF0045Z13001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN.zip)**
- **[RTK0EF0045Z15001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN.zip](./downloads/RTK0EF0045Z15001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN.zip)**

**Patch Files:**
- **[0001-gstreamer-moil-plugin.patch](./downloads/0001-gstreamer-moil-plugin.patch)**
- **[0002-fix_qtsmarthome_url.patch](./downloads/0002-fix_qtsmarthome_url.patch)**

When the download is completed, move all the files into the `yocto` directory.

:::warning
After downloading the packages, please remember to remove the hash appended to the file name to prevent any errors!
:::

## Step 5: Extract the Downloaded Packages

Unzip `.zip` files under the directory `home/user/yocto`.

```bash
unzip RTK0EF0045Z0021AZJ-v3.0.6-update3.zip
```
```bash
unzip RTK0EF0045Z13001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN.zip
```
```bash
unzip RTK0EF0045Z15001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN.zip
```

Create a new directory named `yocto` in your **Dev Container** and move to the working directory.

```bash
mkdir yocto
cd yocto
```

Extract `.tar.gz` files.

```bash
tar zxvf ../RTK0EF0045Z0021AZJ-v3.0.6-update3/rzg_vlp_v3.0.6.tar.gz
```
```bash
tar zxvf ../RTK0EF0045Z13001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN/meta-rz-features_graphics_v1.2.2.tar.gz
```
```bash
tar zxvf ../RTK0EF0045Z15001ZJ-v1.2.2_EN/meta-rz-features_codec_v1.2.2.tar.gz
```

List out the files in the working directory to verify the package contents.

```bash
ls -l
```

If the output is as follows, the packages are installed correctly.

```
extra
meta-gplv2
meta-openembedded
meta-qt5
meta-renesas
meta-rz-features
meta-virtualization
poky
```

## Step 6: Apply Patch Files

Apply a patch file to update `vlp` to `update3`.

```bash
patch -p1 < ../RTK0EF0045Z0021AZJ-v3.0.6-update3/vlpg306-to-vlpg306update3.patch
```

Move to the `meta-renesas` directory.

```bash
cd meta-renesas
```

Apply patch file extras.

```bash
patch -p1 < ../extra/0001-rz-common-recipes-debian-buster-glibc-update-to-v2.2.patch
```
```bash
patch -p1 < ../extra/0001-rz-common-linux-update-linux-kernel-to-the-latest-re.patch
```
```bash
patch -p1 < ../extra/0001-rz-common-gst-plugins-bad-Depending-bayer2raw-if-lay.patch
```

Move back the working directory.

```bash
cd ..
```

:::warning
Please move the two patch files **0001-gstreamer-moil-plugin.patch** and **0002-fix_qtsmarthome_url.patch** into the `yocto` directory before applying the patch commands below.
:::

Apply a patch file to add the GStreamer Moil Plugin.

```bash
patch -p1 < 0001-gstreamer-moil-plugin.patch
```

Apply a patch file to fix the Qt Smart Home URL.

```bash
patch -p1 < 0002-fix_qtsmarthome_url.patch
```

## Step 7: Initialize and Start Image Build

Enter back into your container by using:

```bash
docker start my_container_for_20.04
docker exec -it my_container_for_20.04 /bin/bash
```

Initialize a build using the `oe-init-build-env` script in Poky and set environment variable `TEMPLATECONF` to the below path.

```bash
cd yocto
TEMPLATECONF=$PWD/meta-renesas/meta-rzg2l/docs/template/conf/ source poky/oe-init-build-env build
```

Run the following commands to add necessary layers for AI application to build/conf/bblayers.conf (configration file for layers).

```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-rz-features/meta-rz-graphics
```
```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-rz-features/meta-rz-codecs
```
:::tip
During this step, you might encounter this error:

```bash
ERROR: The following required tools (as specified by HOSTTOOLS) appear to be unavailable in PATH, please install them in order to proceed:
  chrpath cpio diffstat gawk
```

If this happens, install the required packages by running:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install chrpath cpio diffstat gawk -y
```
:::

Run the following command to build the weston image.

```bash
MACHINE=smarc-rzg2l bitbake core-image-weston
```

Building images for the first time typically takes a few hours to complete. You may disconnect from the Dev Container during this process.

:::note
To build the qt5 image, run the following command to add the `meta-qt5` layer.

```bash
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-qt5
```

If you want to add qt5 demonstration to `core-image-qt`, add the following to your `local.conf` file.

```bash
QT_DEMO = "1"
```

Run the following command to build the qt5 image.

```bash
MACHINE=smarc-rzg2l bitbake core-image-qt
```
:::

## Step 8: Flashing Into SD Card

Exit the Dev Container and reconnect to host. Then, go to the `~/build/tmp/deploy/images/smarc-rzg2l` directory. Under this directory, you will see a list of the output files from the build. 

Sample output files:

```
core-image-qt-smarc-rzg2l.wic.gz
core-image-qt-smarc-rzg2l.wic.bmap
```

Insert the SD card into the PC and check the device ID of the SD card by running:

```bash 
sudo fdisk -l
```

Flash the image into SD card:

```bash
sudo bmaptool copy core-image-qt-smarc-rzg2l.wic.gz /dev/sda
```

:::note
If the flash is unsuccessful or showing that the device is busy, unmount `/dev/sda1` and `/dev/sda2` by running these commands below and try again.

```bash
umount /dev/sda1
umount /dev/sda2
```
:::

## Step 9: Booting Up from SD Card

Insert the SD Card into the RZ/G2L board, connect the power input and serial monitor to your personal PC and boot up by long pressing the red button.

![bootup](./img/2-2-2.png)

Open up the serial monitor in VS Code (ensure you have the Serial Monitor Extension installed first), select the port that is connected to the board, ensure you have toggled Terminal Mode and click on **"Start Monitoring"**.

Reboot by pressing on the blue button on the board. You will start seeing start-up messages on the serial monitor. Once the start-up is complete, you will be prompted for a login. Simply enter `root` to login.

![login](./img/2-2-3.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully booted up the RZ/G2L board. On the next tutorial, we will learn how to add programs to the build and execute the program from the board.
