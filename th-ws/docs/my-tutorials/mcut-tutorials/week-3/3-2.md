# 3-2 Generating Remap Files

We aim to develop a GStreamer filter to transform fisheye images into corrected single-angle or equirectangular images. This transformation involves reading a set of X and Y mapping tables to reposition each point, a process known as remapping.

## MOIL Maps Generator

The MOIL Maps Generator website offers an online interface to generate the X and Y map files required for GStreamer commands.

Enter the camera specifications and additional parameters, then press the "Start" button to begin the generation process. A ZIP file will be downloaded. If your browser displays a security warning, click "Keep" to save the file. Decompress the ZIP file before using it.

If you generate maps for projections other than equirectangular, rename the files to EquimatX and EquimatY before using them with GStreamer commands.
