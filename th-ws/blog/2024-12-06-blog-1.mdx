# My First Blog

Here are a few tips you might find useful.

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

And if you don't want a blog: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
