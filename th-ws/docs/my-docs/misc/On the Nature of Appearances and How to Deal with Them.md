# **On the Nature of Appearances and How to Deal with Them**  
  
Appearances, or how things seem to us, fall into four types:  
  
1.	Things are as they appear.  
2.	Things are not as they appear, and we also don’t perceive them that way.  
3.	Things are as they appear, but we fail to see them as such.  
4.	Things are not as they appear, but we perceive them differently.  
  
In each of these cases, it’s the role of an educated person to judge correctly. If something disturbs us, we should apply the appropriate remedy to address it. If philosophical arguments from Pyrrho or the Academics bother us, we need to counter them directly. If misleading appearances trick us into seeing certain things as good when they aren’t, we must work to see them clearly. And if harmful habits are the problem, then we should cultivate habits that oppose them.  
  
For example, if we’re troubled by hearing others say things like, “He died young, his parents are devastated,” we should train ourselves to think differently. Counter negative habits with positive ones, counter sophistry with reason, and prepare ourselves with clear and accurate principles to confront deceiving appearances.  
  
When death appears as something terrible, we need to remember that while it’s natural to avoid what is harmful, death itself is inevitable. We might not have the strength to face it heroically like some legendary figures, but we can at least strive to approach it bravely or encourage others to do so. If we can’t avoid death, why should we fear it? We cannot escape it, so why waste our final moments in dread?   
  
The root of our distress is wanting reality to be different from what it is. If we can change something, we should; if we can’t, anger won’t help. When we can neither alter circumstances nor remove those who stand in our way, resentment builds, even towards the gods. But remember, if piety (reverence for the gods) and our true self-interest are aligned, we can live without constant fear or disappointment. Isn’t this understanding essential?
