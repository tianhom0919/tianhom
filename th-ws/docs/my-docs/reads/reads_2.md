# Stacks and Recursion

In programming, a stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. You can think of it as a stack of plates: the plate you placed last is the first one you take off the top. A stack has two primary operations: 

**Push**   
Add an item to the top of the stack.  

**Pop**  
Remove the item from the top of the stack.
