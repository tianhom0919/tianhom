# 2-1 Setup Docker Container to Build Linux BSP for RZ/G2L

In this tutorial, we will learn how to setup a Docker container to build a Linux BSP for RZ/G2L. Then, we will write the image into an SD card and boot up RZ/G2L from it.

## Docker Container Setup

In your Dev Container, navigate to the `devcontainer.js` file. Replace the contents of the file with the code below:

```json title="devcontainer.json"
{
    "build": {
        "context": "..",
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile.rzg_ubuntu-20.04"
    }
}
```
