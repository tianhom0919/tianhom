# 1-3 Installation of Docker Engine

To get started with Docker Engine on Ubuntu, make sure you meet the prerequisites, and then follow the installation steps.

---

## OS Requirements

To install Docker Engine, you need the 64-bit version of one of these Ubuntu versions:

- Ubuntu Oracular 24.10
- Ubuntu Noble 24.04 (LTS)
- Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS)
- Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS)

Docker Engine for Ubuntu is compatible with x86_64 (or amd64), armhf, arm64, s390x, and ppc64le (ppc64el) architectures.

---

## Step 1: Uninstall Old Versions

Before you can install Docker Engine, you need to uninstall any conflicting packages. Run the following command to uninstall all conflicting packages:

```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done
```

If you have none of these packages installed, you may continue to the installation step.

## Step 2: Set up Docker's `apt` Repository.

Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker `apt` repository. Afterwards, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

## Step 3: Install the Docker packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

This will install all the required packages to use Docker.

## Step 4: Verify the installation by running:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

## Step 5: Post-Installation

If you don't want to preface the `docker` command with `sudo`, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it.

First, create the `docker` group.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```
Add your user to the `docker` group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated. You can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:

```bash
newgrp docker
```
Verify that you can run `docker` commands without `sudo`.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.
