# 8️⃣ Setting Up a Self-Hosted GitLab Instance

GitLab self-hosting refers to running your own instance of GitLab on your own server instead of using GitLab's cloud-based services (GitLab.com). This allows organizations or individuals to have full control over their repositories, CI/CD pipelines, and development workflows while keeping their data private.

---

## Step 1: Update System and Install Dependencies

Before installing GitLab, update and upgrade your system packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

GitLab requires some essential packages. Install them using:

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates tzdata perl
```

If you want GitLab to send emails (e.g., password resets), install Postfix:

```bash
sudo apt install -y postfix
```

## Step 2: Install GitLab

Download the GitLab repository script and install the package:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

If you want the free **Community Edition (CE)** instead of the **Enterprise Edition (EE)**, replace `gitlab-ee` with `gitlab-ce` in the script above.

Replace `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` with your actual domain (or use your server’s IP address if you don’t have one).

```bash
sudo EXTERNAL_URL="http://<YOUR_DOMAIN>" apt install -y gitlab-ee
```

For HTTPS, use:

```bash
sudo EXTERNAL_URL="https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>" apt install -y gitlab-ee
```

GitLab will install and configure itself.

## Step 3: Configure GitLab

The main configuration file is:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
```

You can change settings like:
- External URL
- Port bindings
- Email settings
- Backup configuration

After making changes, apply them:

```bash
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

## Step 4: Adjust Firewall Settings

If you have UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) enabled, allow necessary ports:

```bash
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
```

## Step 5: Access GitLab Web Interface 

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://<YOUR_DOMAIN> or http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>
```

The first time, GitLab will ask for the root password. Get it using:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
```

Log in with the username set as `root` and the password obtained from the file above.

## Step 6: Optional Configurations

### Enable Auto-Start on Boot

Ensure GitLab runs on every system startup:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable gitlab-runsvdir
```

### Backup GitLab

Create a backup to prevent data loss:

```bash
sudo gitlab-backup create
```

Backups are stored in `/var/opt/gitlab/backups/`.

## Conclusion

You now have a fully functional self-hosted GitLab instance running on Ubuntu 22.04. You can start creating repositories, setting up CI/CD, and managing users.
