# 3-7 Extra Materials

GStreamer is compatible with all major operating systems and can integrate with other multimedia frameworks. The implementation of MOIL image functions across platforms aims to efficiently distribute tasks using GStreamer, adapting to varying computational power while maintaining system coherence via network streaming.

X and Y maps are precomputed on high-performance PCs for efficiency, with the current implementation focusing on equirectangular processing for full 360-degree streaming. On the receiver side, further processing such as 360-degree dewarping (e.g., Anypoint) or quad-view mapping can be performed, with the server continuously streaming the processed images. All fisheye-related computations are handled server-side, eliminating the need for fisheye camera parameters on the client side.

Network streaming is currently limited to a resolution of 2048x1536, which may pose challenges for high-resolution applications. Successful implementation on RZ/G2L with MOIL transformations has demonstrated streaming capabilities to PCs, paving the way for future embedded application development. Alternatives to the H.264 codec are being considered to improve processing performance.
